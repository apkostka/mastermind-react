**Mastermind Board Game - React Clone**

![Game Screenshot](https://github.com/apkostka/mastermind-react/blob/master/public/game.png?raw=true)

Simple game recreated in react. Just click on the pegs in the entry box to change their color, then click the blue button to submit a guess. You have 10 tries to guess the code.  

Todo:  
 - Better win / loss handling than alert boxes
 - More instructions / visual cues
 - Add win / loss percent
 - Settings to change number of colors and disallow duplicates
